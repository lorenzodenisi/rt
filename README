To install rt, open a console and cd into this folder.
Then type 

./install.sh

The script require superuser permissions so you will be prompted to type your password.
After installation, the help page can be reached typing

rt -h

It's possible to automatically alias rm command with rt.
Note that in that case "rm -r" will be replaced with "rt -r".
However, to remove recursively with rt, is not necessary any flag.

To remove rt and eventual alias, run 

./uninstall.sh



Enjoy!
